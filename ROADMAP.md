# TourIt — Roadmap

## Vision
An AI-powered audio tour app that researches and narrates the story of any place, playing automatically as you travel. A pre-generated library of stops worldwide means zero per-user AI cost. Free tier offers pre-built city tours; Pro unlocks full content depth, custom tour building, offline download and a contextual Q&A agent.

---

## Architecture Principles

- **Stops are the atomic unit** — a tour is just an ordered list of stops. Each stop is generated once and reused across any number of tours.
- **Generate text upfront, audio lazily** — all 11 category texts generated at batch time (~$0.01/stop). Audio generated on first play and cached forever in R2.
- **Language split** — top 6 languages (EN, ES, FR, DE, PT, IT) generated with Claude. Others translated lazily via DeepL and cached.
- **Practical info is separate** — `stop_practical` updated by cron job independently from narration which rarely changes.
- **Offline-first** — design assuming connectivity is unreliable. Cache aggressively, queue writes, sync when online.
- **Edge-cached** — Cloudflare Workers + KV in front of all stop/tour API responses. Audio on R2 (globally distributed by default).
- **UUID primary keys everywhere** — safe to expose in URLs, work across environments, don't leak catalogue size.

## ⚠️ Pre-Phase 4 Checklist

Before starting Phase 4, confirm these are done:

- [x] **SQL**: `ALTER TABLE cities ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo_url text;`
- [x] **Deploy**: Auto-deploying to Vercel on every push; live at https://tourit.es
- [x] **tourit.es DNS**: Domain live; Supabase Auth URLs updated
- [ ] **SQL**: `ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS comped boolean DEFAULT false;` — needed for comped tracking in cost report
- [ ] **Resend domain**: Verify `tourit.es` in Resend dashboard → set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=TourIt <noreply@tourit.es>` in Vercel
- [ ] **City photos**: Run "🏙 City Photos" + "📷 Stop Photos" in `/admin` for all cities
- [ ] **Google OAuth**: Confirm `https://tourit.es` is in Authorized JavaScript Origins in Google Cloud Console

## Pricing

| Plan | Price | Target user |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | €0 | Casual tourists, try-before-you-buy |
| **Trip Pass** | €5.99 / 7 days | Traveller on a specific trip, impulse buy |
| **Annual Pro** | €16.99 / year (€1.42/mo) | Frequent traveller, 3+ trips/year |

**Rationale:** Monthly subscriptions churn immediately after a trip. Trip pass captures the high-intent moment ("I'm going to Rome next week"). Annual at €1.42/month is below cancel-consideration threshold. Competitors (GPSmyCity, Action Tour Guide) charge €24.99/year — we're 30% cheaper at launch.

**On-demand city generation:** Any city not in the library can be requested by Pro users. The system generates stops + a tour automatically via Tavily research + Claude Haiku. Cost: ~$0.15–0.25/city — negligible against €5.99+ revenue. Generated cities are cached and serve all future users for free. UX: async notification (Option A) for unknown cities; top 200 pre-warmed at launch (Option C). See CITIES_SEED.md for the full plan.
